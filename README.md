# Liberating Structures posters in HD
In this repository we'll find 13 out of the 33 Liberating Structures microstructures that we use in our classes. 
These 13 microstructures are completely digitilized, redesigned, and in high-definition, so basically you can print them in any format you want. 

# Usage
We tend to use it in our Professional Scrum Master - Advanced classes and/or Liberating Structures workshops. 
Printing these microstructures on A0/A1 format definitely gives it a certain WOW factor. 

# Credits
A special shout out to Jenny Yung, our talented Graphic Designer who made this all possible. 

We hope you enjoy it! If there are any questions, feel free to send us an email: info@scrumfacilitators.nl
